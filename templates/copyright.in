 Summary of Important Use Restrictions
 .
 Please Read the Entire Agreement and Definitions Below
 Scope of License
 This Software License Agreement governs your use of the Software. Depending 
 upon your requirements and circumstances, you will be permitted to use either 
 Unity Pro or Unity Personal (formerly known as Unity Free). This Software 
 License Agreement governs use of both Unity Pro and Unity Personal. 
 .
 Primary Differences Between Unity Pro and Unity Personal
 Although Unity Personal has most of the features and functionality as Unity 
 Pro, Unity Personal i) includes certain features that cannot be disabled when 
 your application is launched, including a Unity branded startup screen and 
 certain analytics data collection, ii) does not provide team collaboration 
 functionality, and iii) users will be required to complete a user survey to 
 activate the Software.  Unity Pro users who are not eligible to use Unity 
 Personal may not develop and publish Licensee Content for the iOS and Android 
 platforms without purchasing the applicable Unity Pro Add-On Product license. 
 Unity may monitor your compliance with and enforce these restrictions and 
 requirements including but not limited to monitoring the number of downloads 
 of your Licensee Content and any available revenue estimate data.

 from its use of the Unity Software during the most recently completed fiscal

 for a one time period of thirty (30) days.  Users not eligible to use Unity

 You May Not Use Unity Personal with Unity Pro or any Unity Pro Add-On 
 Products 
 You may not combine or integrate Licensee Content that you develop with Unity 
 Personal simultaneously with any Licensee Content that you develop with Unity 
 Pro or any Unity Pro Add-On Products.  Licensee Content developed with the 
 Unity Personal will be tagged with an identifier that is used to enforce this 
 restriction.  
 One User Per License
 A specific license key is required for each individual using any version of 
 the Software.  Unity Pro users may install the Software on both a primary and 
 a secondary computer for use only by the same user.  You may not use both 
 installations simultaneously.  If you purchase a standard, single license key 
 educational license, you must purchase a license for each computer on which 
 the Software is to be used.

 means of streaming or broadcasting where Licensee Content is primarily

 graphics render commands over the open Internet to end user devices without a 
 separate license from Unity.  This restriction does not prevent end users 
 from remotely accessing Licensee Content from an end user device that is 
 running on another end user device.

 Embedded Software Restriction
 You may not directly or indirectly distribute Licensee Content installed on 
 more than 1,000 electronic devices or systems if such Licensee Content 
 provides the user interface or primary functionality of such electronic 
 device or system without a separate license from Unity.  This restriction 
 does not prevent you from distributing Licensee Content pre-installed on 
 personal computers and consumer electronic devices such as mobile phones, 
 tablets, televisions or set top boxes as long as such Licensee Content does 
 not provide the user interface or primary functionality of such device.
